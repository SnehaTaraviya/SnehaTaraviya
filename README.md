This code is an implementation of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game between a human player and the computer. 
Here's a brief description of each part of the implementation:

**1. Display Board: **
The **display_board()** function prints the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board in a user-friendly format.

**2. Human Move: **
The **enter_move()** function allows the human player to enter their move. It validates the input and updates the board.

**3. List of Free Fields: **
The **make_list_of_free_fields()** function returns a list of all unoccupied positions on the board.

**4. Check Victory: **
The **victory_for()** function checks if there is a winner. It returns 'me' if the computer wins, 'you' if the human wins, or None if there is no winner yet.

**5. Computer Move: **
The **draw_move()** function allows the computer to make a move. It randomly selects a free position and places 'X' there.

**6. Game Initialization and Loop: **
The board is initialized, and the game alternates between human and computer moves until there is a winner or the board is full.
